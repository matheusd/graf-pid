    <p>Let's learn how to code a PID and get some intuition on how it works.</p>    
</div>

<div id="p2">
    <p>Imagine the following situation: you, a recently graduated engineer or
        computer programmer was hired to automate a linear cutting machine.</p>
    
    <p>This machine has an electric motor, conected through a set of gears 
        to a tool (let's say, a saw) that moves in a vertical line.</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p3">    
    <p>When the motor spins clockwise, the tool moves in one direction (let's say, 
        from bottom to top or "positive" direction) and when the motor spins counter-clockwise, the tool
        moves in the inverse direction (from top to bottom, or "negative" direction).</p>
    
    <p>Each revolution of the motor produces a proportional movement of the tool.
        Let's say that, due to the specific transmission system, one revolution
        of the engine equals a 1 mm (one millimeter) displacement of the the tool.
        And the whole machine has a maximum speed of 3mm/second (which means the
        motor can spin at a maximum rate of 3 revolutions per second).</p>
</div>    
    
<div id="p4">    
    
    <p>In order to automate this system, you have only three physical elements you
        can interact with: the current position motor (which, just as a reminder,
        is proportional to the position of the tool), the desired position of the tool
        (let's say it's a given stock that needs cutting) and the speed of that
        the motor spins, which you can use to position the tool.</p>
    
    <p>How would you place the tool at the desired position if you were controlling
        the machine manually?</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p5">        
    <p>Let's say the tool must be at the position x = 500mm. Meaning, we want to spin
        the motor such that the tool is positioned 500 mm above its central point
        of reference.</p>

    <p>Manually, we'd do the following: spin the motor until it is near the 
        desired position. As it aproaches this position, we decelerate it
        until it is as close as possible to it. At that moment, we turn off
        the motor.</p>
    
    <p>To help you out, I've put the desired position as 500.</p>
    
    <p>Try to reach it, manually controlling the speed of the motor!</p>
    
    <script>
        function script_p5() {
            $("#posDesejada").val(500);
            $("#btnSetarPosDesejada").click();
            $("#btnSetarVel").focus();
        }
    </script>
</div>    
    
<div id="p6">    
    <p>Ok. Manually, we can position the motor/tool near the desired position.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you can notice a couple of things: if you want to move to tool downards,
        you must input a negative velocity. If the tool overshoots the desired point,
        you have to set the speed to the inverse value (inverting the sign of the speed).
        To keep the tool at a fixed position, your speed must be equal to zero.</p>
        
</div>    
    
<div id="p7">        
    
    <p>
    How could we do the same procedure in an automated way? How could we create
        a computer program that is able to position the tool, taking into account
        that we have only two input variables (the current position and the desired
        position) and only one output mechanism (the speed of the motor)?</p>
    
    <p>
    With your programming knowledge, which would be the most simple software you
    could create to solve this problem? Think about it a bit.</p>    
    
    <script>
        function script_p7() {
            exibirFase(1);
        }
    </script>
</div>    
    
<div id="p8">        
    
    <p>The most trivial algorithm I can imagine would be something like this:
        if the desired position for the tool is above the current position (in
        other words, in the positive side of the movement axis') we spin the motor
        in the positive direction. Otherwise, we (meaning, if the desired position
        is below the current position - negative side of the axis) we spin the 
        motor in the negative direction.</p>
    
    <p>Written in code, it would be something like you see above.</p>
    
    <p>Try to alter the desired position to various values to see what happens
        (try for example, 100, 200, -100, 0).</p>
        
    <script>
        function script_p8() {
            exibirFase(2);
            $("#habPid").attr("checked", "checked");
            
            $("#posDesejada").val(100);
            $("#btnSetarPosDesejada").click();
            $("#btnSetarVel").focus();            
        }
    </script>
</div>    
    
<div id="p9">        
    
    <p>Remember: spinning the motor with a positive speed means it moves up. 
    Spinning the motor with negative speed means it moves down.</p>
    
    
    <p>Check that, enabling this code, when you get close to the desired position,
    the speed of the motor starts to oscilate significantly. Why?</p>
    
</div>    
    
<div id="p10">            
    
    <p>It's because we forgot the zero situation! When the desired position is 
        exactly equal to the current position, we can stop the motor completely.</p>
    
    <script>
        function script_p10() {
            exibirFase(3);
        }
    </script>
</div>    
    
<div id="p11">            
    
    <p>Perfect! Now our automated system is capable of moving a linear axis and
    position it anywhere. Or almost. Try to position it at a non-integer (decimal)
    position. Try 100.30 for example. What happens?</p>
    
</div>    
    
<div id="p12">            
    
    <p>More oscilation at the motor speed. This kind of issue can be called a
    numerical instability: our algorithm doesn't behave well with fractional numbers.</p>
    
    <p>How can we make the algorith more stable? Can you think of an alternative?</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p13">            
    
    <p>Let's identify when the problem happens. It happens when the distance
    between the desired position and the current position is smaller than
    the speed (fixed at 1 mm/second).</p>    
    
    <p>When the distance is smaller than this value, the motor jumps to 
    a position beyond the desired (an <i>overshoot</i>). At the next cycle, 
    our algorithm tries to correct this jump by coming back, however it goes
    again beyond the desired position.</p>
        
</div>    
    
<div id="p14">            
    
    <p>A practical example: if we wish to reach the position x = 100.30 and the 
    current position is 100.00, the motor's speed of +1 will provoke an overshoot 
    to position 101.00. At the next cycle, the speed will be recalculated to -1
    and the motor will move to position x = 100.00 again. This back and forth is
    what causes the oscilation.</p>
    
    <p>We should modify this algorithm to consider the case when the difference
    between the current position and the desired position is less than 1
    (the movement speed). How can we do that?</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p15">            
    
    <p>One possibility is indicated above. We must consider the case when the
    motor is below the desired point and above it.</p>
    
    <p>This algorithm is more robust than the previous ones. But it has two problems:
    a functional one and an aestetic one.</p>
    
    
    <script>
        function script_p15() {
            exibirFase(4);
        }
    </script>
</div>    
    
<div id="p16">            
    
    <p>Though it solves our current problem, it doesn't take into account the
    fact that the motor's speed could be higher.</p>    
    
    <p>Another problem is that this algorithm is complex: look at the amount
    of <i>IF</i>clauses, one inside the other. It isn't a pleasant code to
    look, understand and debug.</p>
    
    <p>How can we simplify this code?</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p17">            

    <p>The first thing we can notice is that this code is entirely based in comparisons
    between the current and the desired positions. We can simplify the relationship
    between these two variables by introducing a third: the concept of a "following
    error".</p>
    
    <p>The following error is the difference between the current and the desired
    positions. Quite literally: it's the first variable minus the second one.</p>
    
    <p>The following error (or more simply, "error") is a measure of the distance
    between the current and desired positions. It shows how far away one is from
    the other.</p>
</div>    
    
<div id="p18">            
    
    <p>The larger the error, the farther the tool is from where we want it to be.
    The smaller, the closer. When the error is exactly zero, the tool is exactly
    where we want it to be.</p>
    
    
    <p>With this notion of "error" we can simplify our algorithm the following
    way: instead of comparing the positions between themselves, we compare
    only if the error is grater than zero (we need to move up) or if the error
    is smaller than zero (we need to move down).</p>
    
    <script>
        function script_p18() {
            exibirFase(5);
        }
    </script>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p19">            
    
    <p>If the error is between zero and the correction speed, we move the
    motor just enough for it to reach the desired position.</p>
    
    <p>Try to apply various movement situations and verify that it really works!</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p20">            
    
    <p>This algorithm is already simpler to understand. But we haven't solved the
    maximum speed problem. Can we do better than this?</p>
    
    
    <p>Notice how on this last algorithm the speed of the motor always follows the
    error: if the error is positive, the speed is positive. If the error is negative,
    the speed is negative. We could also call this speed the <i>error correction speed</i>.</p>
    
    <p>We say that the error correction speed is always <i>proportional</i> to
    the error. If the error is big, the speed must also be high. If the error
    is small, the speed must be low.</p>
</div>    
    
<div id="p21">            
    
    <p>The keyword here is <b>proportional</p>. With this concept of error,
    we can say (code) that the speed is always equal to the error (keeping
    in mind that the motor will only speed up to it's maximum speed anyway).</p>
    
    <p>Let's see how to implement that.</p>
    
    <script>
        function script_p21() {
            exibirFase(6);
        }
    </script>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p22">            
    
    <p>What do you think? Can you understand how the speed is proportional to the
    error?</p>
    
    <p>The only thing that is really missing and that we could have in our program
    is a way to show whether we want a more sudden (an fast) error correcting speed
    or a more sensitive (and slow) one. We can, as an example, instead of use the
    full error as the correction speed, ask for only half of it. Or double.</p>
    
</div>    
    
<div id="p23">            
    
    <p>Since the speed is proportional to the error, we can insert a "compensating
    factor". Another possible name would be "porportional constant". Let's give
    this constant a nickname, and call it "kp". The algorithm to calculate 
    the movement, than, would be like this.</p>
    
    <script>
        function script_p23() {
            exibirFase(7);
        }
    </script>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p24">            
    
    <p>There you go! We have just coded a PID (actually, just a "P") loop.
    The correction speed is calculated, inside the movement function, as 
    a speed proportional to the error.</p>
    
    <p>The other elements of a PID controller can also be easily inserted.</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p25">            
    
    <p>Adding up the errors as they happen in an accumulator, we have (in a sense)
    the "accumulated history" (or integral) of the error.</p>
    
    <p>Calculating the difference between the error of the last period and 
    current error we have a measure of the error's speed (or derivative).</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id="p26">            
    
    <p>We can use the same trick and apply proportionality constants in these
    two other factors (let's nickname them "ki" and "kd" for the integral and
    derivative errors).</p>
    
    
    <script>
        function script_p26() {
            exibirFase(8);
        }
    </script>
